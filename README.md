# NLP with Python

## Running Code Samples

### Prerequisites

To run the code samples in this repo you need Python 3.7 installed. The easiest way to do this is with Homebrew `brew install python`. With Python installed install VirtualEnv with `python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv`.

### Setup Code

Inside the `src` folder, run `python3 -m venv env` to create your virtual environment, run `source env/bin/activate` to activate it.

Now run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages. When this has completed run `python3 setup.py` to download some more required NLTK pacakges.

### Running Code

To run any of the code samples simply do `python3 filename.py`.
